British Columbia’s
Wild Salmon Strategy
Wild salmon are crucial to the success of our economy,
the prosperity of coastal communities, and the lives, culture, and
history of indigenous peoples. They are integral to coastal ecosystems,
yet the pressures they face are complex and growing. 
We are working together to develop a wild salmon
strategy that will support restoring healthy and abundant
wild salmon populations in B.C. 
This will involve engaging experts and stakeholders
from across the province, in order to develop a made-in-B.C.
action plan that clearly outlines a path forward for sustaining
wild salmon today and for future generations.
